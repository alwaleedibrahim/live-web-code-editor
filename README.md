# Live Web Code Editor

## Overview

Welcome to the `live-web-code-editor` repository! This project provides a live web-based code editor that supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this fork, auto-save functionality has been added using `localStorage` to ensure that users' code is saved and automatically loaded when they revisit or refresh the page.

## Features

- **Live Code Editing**: Write and edit code with real-time feedback.
- **Auto-Save with LocalStorage**: Automatically saves your code to `localStorage` as you type.
- **Auto-Load on Revisit/Refresh**: Automatically loads the saved code from `localStorage` when you revisit or refresh the page.
